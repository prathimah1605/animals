            <h2>SNAKES</h2><img src="snake 1.jpg" width="400" align="right">
            <p><strong><em>SNAKES FACTS<hr></em></strong>
                1.  They have a very big family According to the latest count, there are 3,789 snake species,<br><br> making them the second largest group of reptiles after lizards.<br><br> 
                        They are divided into 30 different families and numerous subfamilies. Australia is home to approximately 140 of them.<br><br><br><br>
                
                2. They are “solar-powered” and rely fully on external heat or light sources
                    Reptiles sometimes get labelled ‘cold-blooded’<br><br> but this is incorrect as their blood isn’t actually cold.
                    The accurate term is ectothermicmeaning their body temperature is variable<br><br> and regulated by external sources.
                    Unlike mammals and birds that are able to internally regulate their body temperature,<br><br> reptiles need to use sources of heat,
                    like the sun, to warm up.A green snake coiling a leaf Photo by Alfonso Castro on Unsplash<br><br><br><br><br>
                
               3. Not all snakes lay eggs You might have learned in school that reptiles are different from mammals
                    because they lay eggs.<br><br>While we like to classify and categorize everything around us,
                    nature has its own rules.<br><br>While approximately 70% of snakes lay eggs, others don’t. Snakes living in especially colder climates
                    have live births because the eggs wouldn’t survive outside.<br><br><br><br><br>

               1.   Snakes don't have eyelids
                    Ever wondered why snakes might give you an eerie feeling? They don’t have eyelids!<br> This means they don’t
                    blink and have to sleep with their eyes wide open.<br><br>Instead of eyelids they have a
                    thin membrane attached to each eye to protect them. <br><br>The membrane is called the ‘brille,’ which in German means glasses.<br><br><br><br>
                
               2.   They smell with their tongues 
                    Snakes do have nostrils, but they don’t use them to smell. <br><br>
                    Instead they have evolved to smell with their tongue and by using their Jacobson’s organ in the roof of their mouth. <br><br>
                    Their smell is quite excellent and has also been described as “smelling in stereo”. <br><br>
                    They have a forked tongue and multiple receptors able to pick up different amounts of chemical cues.<br><br><br><br>
                
              3.    Their table manners are different than ours
                    When snakes are eating, they can’t help but to swallow their food whole because they can’t chew. Instead,<br><br>
                    snakes have very flexible lower jaws which allows them to eat animals who are 75% - 100% larger than their own head.<br> <br>
                    The chemicals in their digestive track will do all the work and break down the food once ingested.<br><br><br><br>

                <strong>SNAKES HAVE 5 FORMS OF LOCATION  </strong><br><br><br><img src="snake 2.jpg" width="200">
                <br><br>
               1.   Imagine a snake moving through the grass. What do you picture? The well-known s-movement? <br><br>This wouldn’t be surprising,
                    because this is the most common form of locomotion in snakes, also known as lateral undulation. But snakes have four other
                    types of movement.<br><br> Arboreal snakes, for example, use a form of locomotion which uses seven times more energy,
                    called concertina. <br><br>There is even a special locomotion used for when a snake tries to escape on a smooth surface,
                    known as slide pushing.<br><br><br><br>

                <br>
                <p>1) India is home to 80 percent of tigers in the world.
                      In 2006, India estimated that there were 1,411 tigers <br>which increased to 1,706 in 2010, 2,226 in 2014 and 2,967 in 2018.<br><br>

                    2) Tigers are good swimmers!
                    Unlike most members of the cat family, they like water and often cool off in pools or streams<br><br>
                    
                    3) Tigers are solitary hunters, and generally search for food alone at night.
                    They quietly stalk their prey <br>until they are close enough to pounce 
                    then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head. Ouch!<br><br>
                    
                    4) A tiger’s roar can be heard as far as three kilometres away.
                    SO when they want to be heard, you’ll know about it, gang!<br><br>
                    
                    5) At full speed, tigers can reach up to 65km/h.
                    That’s right – they may be big and heavy, but tigers are by no means slow movers!<br><br><br><br><br><br>
